This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify state outside of a `setState` call.  It's subtle because it might not always throw an explicit error, but instead lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Incorrect: Directly modifying count
    count = count + 1; // this is wrong!!
  }, []);

  return <Text>Count: {count}</Text>;
}
```
